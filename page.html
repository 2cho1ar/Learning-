		<p align="center">There are varieties of <strong>lemonade</strong> found throughout the world.[1] In North America and South Asia, cloudy <strong>lemonade</strong> dominates. <br>It is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup or honey.[2] In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Central Europe and Australia, a carbonated lemonade soft drink is more common. Despite the differences between the drinks, each is known simply as "lemonade" in countries where it is dominant.</p>
		<p align="center">The suffix "-ade" may also be applied to other similar drinks made with different fruits, such as <em>limeade</em>, <em>orangeade</em>, or <em>cherryade</em>.[3]</p>
		<p align="center">A drink made with lemons, dates, and honey was consumed in 13th and 14th century <em>Egypt</em>, including a lemon juice drink with sugar, known as qatarmizat.[4] In 1676, a company known as <em>Compagnie de Limonadiers</em> sold <strong>lemonade</strong> in Paris.[5] Vendors carried tanks of lemonade on their backs and dispensed cups of the soft drink to Parisians.[6]</p>
